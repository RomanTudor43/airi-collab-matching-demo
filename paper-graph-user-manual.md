# Research Paper Graph Author Guide

This guide explains the graph-related Strapi fields introduced on this branch and how they are meant to be used by editors, authors, and maintainers.

The key idea is simple:

- `importEligible` controls whether a person is used by the Python import pipeline.
- `graphEligible` controls whether a publication is included in the graph rebuild.
- `sourceKind=manual` means the record is editor-owned and should not be overwritten by the import pipeline.
- Macro and meso relations are mostly pipeline-managed for automated publications.

## 1. The Two Main Switches

### Person: `importEligible`

Location: `Person`

Default: `false`

What it does:

- When `importEligible` is enabled, the Python pipeline may use that person as an import source.
- If it is disabled, the person is ignored by author-based imports.

Use this for:

- researchers who should be synced from OpenAlex or other source systems
- people who should not trigger paper imports, such as administrative staff or profiles that are not part of the publication workflow

Important:

- This field does not control whether a person appears on the site.
- It only controls whether the import pipeline treats the person as a valid source.

### Publication: `graphEligible`

Location: `Publication`

Default: `true`

What it does:

- When `graphEligible` is enabled, the publication participates in graph rebuilds.
- The pipeline reloads all graph-eligible publications from Strapi and computes links, duplicates, communities, embeddings, macro assignment, and meso assignment from that set.
- When it is disabled, the publication is excluded from the graph pipeline.

Use this for:

- publications that should remain in the database but not appear in the graph
- records that are incomplete or should be held out from automated graph processing

Important:

- `graphEligible` is not the same as `sourceKind`.
- A publication can be manual and still graph-eligible.
- A publication can be graph-ineligible even if it is otherwise valid content.

## 2. Ownership: Manual vs Automated

### `sourceKind`

Location: `Publication`

Values:

- `manual`
- `openAlexAutomated`

What it does:

- `manual` marks a publication as editor-curated.
- `openAlexAutomated` marks a publication as pipeline-managed.

Pipeline behavior:

- existing automated records may be updated by the import pipeline
- manual records are protected from automated overwrite
- if a source import finds a record with the same title, DOI, or OpenAlex ID, the pipeline reuses that record instead of creating a duplicate

Practical rule:

- If an editor creates or curates a publication in Strapi, leave it as `manual` unless you explicitly want the Python pipeline to manage it.

## 3. Publication Fields Used by the Graph Pipeline

These fields are either written by the pipeline or used as graph metadata.

### Embedding and graph metadata

Location: `Publication`

Fields:

- `embedding`
- `embeddingModel`
- `embeddingSourceHash`
- `embeddingUpdatedAt`
- `lastGraphIndexedAt`

Meaning:

- These are pipeline-managed technical fields.
- They describe how the current embedding was produced and when the record was last processed.
- Editors should normally not change them manually.

### Community fields

Fields:

- `community`
- `communityLabel`
- `secondaryClusters`

Meaning:

- These are graph outputs produced from the similarity and clustering pipeline.
- They are not the primary editorial taxonomy.
- Treat them as computed metadata, not hand-edited categorization.

### Macro and meso placement fields

Fields:

- `graphMacroPrimary`
- `graphMacroTags`
- `graphMesoPrimary`
- `graphMesoTags`

Meaning:

- `graphMacroPrimary` is the main macro category used for placement.
- `graphMacroTags` are secondary macro matches and should be treated as highlights.
- `graphMesoPrimary` is the main meso bucket used for placement.
- `graphMesoTags` are secondary meso matches and should be treated as highlights.

Pipeline rule:

- For non-manual publications, these relations are regenerated on each global graph rebuild.
- For manual publications, the pipeline is intended to leave editorial ownership alone.

## 4. Macro Taxonomy: `GraphMacro`

Location: `GraphMacro`

These are the broad research domains used by the graph pipeline.

Fields:

- `name`
- `slug`
- `description`
- `keywords`
- `sortOrder`
- `isActive`

How the pipeline uses them:

- The pipeline builds a text representation from `name`, `keywords`, and `description`.
- That text is embedded and compared against each paper embedding.
- The best match becomes `graphMacroPrimary`.
- Additional matches can be stored in `graphMacroTags`.

What editors should change:

- edit `name` when the macro label itself should change
- edit `keywords` when you want to steer matching toward a different vocabulary
- edit `description` when you want more context or a clearer human-facing explanation
- edit `sortOrder` to influence presentation order
- use `isActive` to hide a macro from active use without deleting it

What not to do:

- do not manually assign macro relations on every publication as a maintenance strategy
- do not treat `graphMacroTags` as a replacement for `graphMacroPrimary`

## 5. Meso Taxonomy: `GraphMeso`

Location: `GraphMeso`

These are the mid-level topic buckets used by the graph UI and pipeline.

Fields:

- `name`
- `slug`
- `description`
- `keywords`
- `sortOrder`
- `isActive`
- `macro`

How the pipeline uses them:

- The pipeline creates or updates meso nodes from topic superclusters.
- Each meso is associated with a macro.
- Publications are then tagged with `graphMesoPrimary` and `graphMesoTags`.

What editors should change:

- edit `name` to improve the human-facing label
- edit `keywords` to help the meso better reflect its topic cluster
- edit `description` to clarify what belongs in the bucket
- edit `sortOrder` to control display order
- edit `isActive` to temporarily disable a meso without deleting it
- edit `macro` when a meso belongs under a different broad domain

What not to do:

- do not use meso fields as a manual per-paper override mechanism
- do not expect paper placement to stay fixed if the pipeline is rerun and the taxonomy changes

## 6. Recommended Editor Workflow

### If you are adding or editing a person

1. Set `importEligible=true` only if that person should be used as an import source.
2. Leave it `false` for non-research personnel or profiles that should not trigger imports.

### If you are adding or editing a publication

1. Leave `sourceKind=manual` for curated records.
2. Set `graphEligible=true` if the publication should participate in the graph.
3. Set `graphEligible=false` if the publication should stay in Strapi but be excluded from graph generation.
4. Avoid hand-editing embedding, community, macro, or meso output fields unless you are intentionally changing the underlying taxonomy.

### If you are editing graph categories

1. Use `GraphMacro` to control broad domains.
2. Use `GraphMeso` to control subtopics within a macro.
3. Change names, keywords, and descriptions when you want the pipeline to classify future rebuilds differently.

## 7. What the Python Pipeline Does on Sync

The current sync flow is:

1. load source people, filtered by `importEligible`
2. fetch papers for those people from the source system
3. deduplicate against existing Strapi publications using OpenAlex ID, DOI, and title matching
4. create or update automated publications
5. reload all `graphEligible` publications from Strapi
6. recompute graph links, duplicates, communities, macro assignments, and meso assignments

This means the graph is always based on the current eligible Strapi corpus, not just on the freshly imported batch.

## 8. Practical Rules of Thumb

- Use `importEligible` to decide who can seed imports.
- Use `graphEligible` to decide which publications participate in the graph.
- Use `sourceKind=manual` for editorially managed publications.
- Use `GraphMacro` and `GraphMeso` to shape the taxonomy, not individual publication records.
- Expect macro and meso assignments to be regenerated for automated publications when the pipeline runs.

## 9. If You Need One Sentence Per Field

- `importEligible`: this person may seed the import pipeline.
- `graphEligible`: this publication should be included in graph rebuilds.
- `sourceKind`: this record is manual or pipeline-managed.
- `graphMacroPrimary`: the main broad-domain assignment.
- `graphMacroTags`: additional broad-domain matches.
- `graphMesoPrimary`: the main mid-level topic assignment.
- `graphMesoTags`: additional mid-level matches.

If you want, the next step can be a shorter editor-facing version for non-technical users, or a companion appendix that lists every graph-related field in table form.
